# RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma Detection

This is my repository for the RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma Detection Kaggle competition.

## Overview

- **Competition Link:** [RSNA 2023 Abdominal Trauma Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2023-abdominal-trauma-detection)

## Goal

This competition aims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to assist in the rapid and accurate detection of abdominal traumatic injuries from CT scans. The development of advanced algorithms can significantly enhance trauma care and improve patient outcomes.

## Project

In the [`rnsa-2023-abdominal-trauma_complete.ipynb`](https://github.com/odartsi/Healthcare/blob/main/RNSA_AbdominalTrauma/rnsa-2023-abdominal-trauma_complete.ipynb) file, I have developed a multi-head classification model using transfer learning to address the competition's goals.
