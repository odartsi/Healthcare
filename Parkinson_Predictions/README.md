This is an analysis of the [`Kaggle competition`](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/overview)

## Goal of the Competition
The goal of this competition is to predict MDS-UPDR scores, which measure progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. The Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. You will develop a model trained on data of protein and peptide levels over time in subjects with Parkinson’s disease versus normal age-matched control subjects.

## Context
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a disabling brain disorder that affects movements, cognition, sleep, and other normal functions. Unfortunately, there is no current cure—and the disease worsens over time. It's estimated that by 2037, 1.6 million people in the U.S. will have Parkinson’s disease, at an economic cost approaching $80 billion. Research indicates that protein or peptide abnormalities play a key role in the onset and worsening of this disease. Gaining a better understanding of this—with the help of data science—could provide important clues for the development of new pharmacotherapies to slow the progression or cure Parkinson’s disease.

My approach to this project is given in the [LSTM_Time_Series_Forecasting_Parkinson_Disease`](https://github.com/odartsi/Healthcare/blob/main/Parkinson_Predictions/LSTM_Time_Series_Forecasting_Parkinson_Disease.ipynb)
